# Fusion Extension : Copyright

### Extend Fusion with a Copyright Element.

The Copyright Element adds a copyright to the page with the year and copyright symbol. The year on the copyright updates automatically, so once the Element is added, there's no need to periodically update it.

[Learn more about the Copyright Extension in the Fusion User Guide](https://agencydominion.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/220113648-Copyright)

**Requires the core [Fusion](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fusion/) plugin.**
